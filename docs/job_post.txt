Hi all, we have been developing a React-based review app and we need an experienced Shopify developer to finish the development of our review app.

The react app is partially completed in terms of app structure and base features but requires further development and debugging to be fully functional.

App requirements.


- Debugging and testing the existing app/fixing any errors to ensure itâ€™s ready to deploy to the shopify App Store

fixing the payment plans, onboarding pages, sorting out email templates and making sure reviews show up properly.

- Someone who can check in regularly with updates on the progress of the app
- Adding some additional features or settings and managing reviews
- Any other small coding tasks that pop up along the way

Interested people should provide the following:

- A bit about yourself and your Shopify app development experience
- Examples of previous Shopify apps/portfolio
- Estimated timeline and total budget.
